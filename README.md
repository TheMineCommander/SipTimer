# SipTimer
It's not pretty, but it works. You can use it to make sure you drink enough water. Keep in mind that it is not meant for negative numbers or the such, as it might break. Use at your own risk, blah, blah, blah.
To use, run the program. I know, I know. I have to say it, though.
You will get a popup asking how many ounces you want to drink. Take a guess what to do here.
A similar popup will ask how long you want the program to last. This is measured in hours.
After that, a window will pop up every 30 minutes telling you to drink a certain amount of sips.

FYI
--
THIS IS BASED OFF OF APPROXIMATION. NOTHING CAN BE COMPLETELY ACCURATE.
In this, the sip size is 23 millileters.
This program uses rounding, so numbers like 1 ounce over 2 hours won't work.
Just use it as intended.
